# Future Ideas

- Output format selector (MP3 128/320, Ogg Vorbis, Opus) configurable per-station via station.yaml
- Voice decorator pipeline: Whisper word-level timestamps on TTS WAV, then apply effects per-word
  - SFX overlay on keywords (cymbal on "Dong!", rimshot, airhorn, etc.)
  - Speed/tempo changes for sections ("talking fast" → speed up)
  - Echo/delay on trigger words
  - Background ambiance beds (forest, space station, vinyl crackle, rain)
  - Dramatic pause insertion before emphasized words
  - Lo-fi radio filter for "breaking news" style segments
  - Reverb/cathedral on announcements
  - Whisper effect (quiet + breathy) for "secret" moments
  - Pitch shifting (drop for "deep", raise for "tiny")
  - Stinger/jingle hits at start/end of voice segments
  - Chorus/double effect on station name or important words
